# Introduction

- A project meant to practice Test-drven development.  
- Based on the classic battleship game, where players can play against the computer.  

## Features

- Players can reposition ships by clicking on the 'Reset' button to place ships on randomized coordinates.  
- Both the player and computer have five ships each, and the first to destroy all of the opponent's ships wins.
